        <h1>Registration on Lease</h1>

        <p>Nearly all of the lease services require LAA Registration Services to 
            formally register the changes made to the lease. Registration occurs 
            after LAA Lease Services has completed the preparation of the lease 
            documents and the customer has signed and returned the relevant paperwork 
            as well as paid the required fees. </p>
