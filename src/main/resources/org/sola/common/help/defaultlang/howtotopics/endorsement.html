        <h1>Endorsement</h1>

        <p>Endorsement is a transfer of the lease to new lessee(s) due to succession 
            or inheritance. The process for the Endorsement service is similar to 
            that for Transfer Lease, with an additional step to print the Endorsement 
            of Succession letter after you have recorded the new lessee details and 
            removed the original lessee details. Refer to the steps described in the 
            Transfer Lease section for guidance.  </p>
