<h2>Power of Attorney</h2>
    <p>A Power of Attorney is a legal document that authorises a person (attorney) 
        to act on behalf of another person (grantor) in private affairs, business 
        or some other legal matter. Power of Attorney documents can be registered 
        in SOLA and linked into applications to justify land transactions made by 
        the attorney on behalf of the grantor. 

        <br>It is possible to search for registered Power of Attorney documents 
        using the Document search, however the Power of Attorney tab provides additional 
        search criteria allowing you to search for Power of Attorney documents using 
        the Attorney name or the name of the person the attorney is acting on behalf 
        of (i.e. grantor). 

        <br>Both searches will return current and historic (i.e. canceled) Power 
        of Attorney documents however these searches exclude new Power of Attorney 
        documents that are not yet registered. To search for pending Power of Attorney 
        documents, use the Application Search to locate the document using the Document 
        reference number.
