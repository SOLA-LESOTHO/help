        <h1>Grant of New Lease</h1>

        <p>It is the responsibility of LAA Lease Services to assess the information 
            provided for the new lease and either prepare the new lease documentation or 
            reject the new lease request. If the new lease is granted, the Letter of Offer 
            and the Lease will be sent to the lessee(s) for their signature(s). Once the 
            lessees have signed the new lease documentation and paid the necessary fees, 
            LAA Registration Services will formally register the new lease.  </p>
