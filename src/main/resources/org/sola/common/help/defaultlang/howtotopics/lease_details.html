<h1>Lease Details</h1>

    It can be accessed from the Rights and Restrictions tab on the Property Details 
    screen by selecting a Lease right (current, historic or pending) and clicking the

<p>To create, change or terminate a lease you must first lodge an application with 
    the appropriate service (e.g. Grant for New Lease, Transfer Lease, Termination 
    of a Lease, etc.). 

<br>Details that can be captured for a lease include

        <ul>
            
            <li>General &#8211; General details of the lease including the lease 
                number, lease term and ground rent details. SOLA provides support 
                to calculate ground rent for new leases, but does not currently 
                contain a ground rent payments history.   <br>
            </li>
            <li>Lessee &#8211; The person, persons or organization that are registered 
                as the lessee(s) for the property. Note that one of the lesseeâ€™s 
                must be flagged as the Lessee Account Holder (using the Lessee 
                account holder party role). This is used by the finance system 
                to determine which lessee to send invoices to.   <br>
            </li>
            <li>Special Conditions &#8211; All leases issued by LAA are subject 
                statutory conditions. Where additional conditions have been established, 
                these are recorded on the Special Conditions section.  <br>
            </li>
            <li>Registration &#8211; The Date of Registration and the Registration 
                Number and registration payment details such as Registration Fee, 
                Stamp Duty and/or Transfer Duty.   <br>
            </li>
 
        </ul>
