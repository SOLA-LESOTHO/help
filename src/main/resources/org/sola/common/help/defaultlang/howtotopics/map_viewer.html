        <h1>SOLA Map Viewer<br>
        </h1>

        <p>The SOLA Map Viewer allows you to navigate and interact with the
            geospatial data managed by SOLA. It can be accessed from the Map &gt;
            Ctrl + Open Map menu or selecting <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/05_world_icon.png"></p><br>
        <p><img style="width: 1129px; height: 728px;" alt="" src="../images/10_map_viewer.png"></p>

        <p>The SOLA Map Viewer includes a toolbar for navigating and querying the 
            map as well as two tabs; Layers and Find. The Layers tab can be used 
            to control the geospatial data displayed on the map while the Find 
            tab that can be used to quickly locate plots and other geospatial 
            features in the map.
            
            The tools provided for the SOLA Map Viewer are:</p>

        <ul>

            <li>Zoom to Extent <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/11_full_extent_icon.png"></li>
            <li>Zoom out <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/12_zoom_out_icon.png"></li>
            <li>Zoom in <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/13_zoom_in_icon.png"></li>
            <li>Pan <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/14_pan_icon.png"></li>
            <li>Information Tool <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/15_information_tool_icon.png"><br>
            </li>
            <li>Print <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/50_print_icon.jpg"></li>
            <li>Export to KML <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/65_export_kml_icon.jpg"></li>

        </ul>

        <p>The SOLA Map Viewer can also support additional map tools for
            editing and related spatial tasks (e.g. Locate Application). These
            tools are described in the relevant How To sections</p>

        <h2>Map Scale and Location</h2>

        <p>The scale of the map can be controlled using the Zoom in, Zoom out 
            and Zoom to extent tools. The desired scale can also be entered 
            directly into the Scale text box in the bottom right of the map. </p>

        <p>A scale bar is displayed to help determine distances on the map. Note that 
            due to variations in screen resolution, the scale bar is indicative 
            only and it should not be used to obtain accurate measurements from the map.</p>
        
        <p>As you pass the mouse over the map you will see map coordinates 
            displayed in the bottom left corner under the Layers and Find tabs. 
            This information can be used to determine coordinate locations on the map.</p>


        <h2>Layers</h2>

        <p>The Layers tab identifies the layers of geospatial data that can be displayed in the map. You can show or hide these layers by 
            checking or clearing the checkbox next to the layer name
            <br>
            <img style="width: 248px; height: 392px;" alt="" src="../images/layers.jpg">
            <br>
            By clicking the triangle beside each layer name you can also see the 
            symbology used to illustrate the geospatial data at different map scales. 
            Using the map scale to control the layer symbology ensures the map 
            does not become overly crowded with detail which might otherwise 
            impair navigation or comprehension of the information displayed by the map.    
            <br>
            The default layers available for SOLA Lesotho include
        <ul>

            <li>Plot Nodes	Illustrates the location of current plot nodes. Nodes
            only display when the map scale is less than 1:3,000</li> 
           <li>Roads	Shows the location of roads. Major  roads will display when
           the map scale is less than 1:90,000 with minor roads only displaying at scales
           less than 1:10,000</li> 
            <li>Pending Plots	New plots that have been created by a survey 
                subdivision or amalgamation. These parcels remain pending 
                until the application that created them is approved. </li>
            <li>Historic Plots with Registered Leases	This layer shows plots 
                that have been subdivided or amalgamated into new plots, but 
                still have registered leases. </li>
            <li>Subplots    Illustrates the location of subplots used to define 
                the areas of a sublease</li>
            <li>Plots   Illustrates the location of current plots</li>
            <li>Coordinate Systems  Illustrates the approximate boundary of the 
                Lo27 and Lo29 coordinate systems</li>
            <li>Orthophoto	Aerial photograph(s) that have been corrected for lens distortion, 
                camera tilt and topography to ensure they have a uniform scale 
                and are suitable for map display.</li>

        </ul>

    </p>

    <h2>Find</h2>

    <p>
        You can use the Find tab to perform spatial searches to quickly locate parcels or other geospatial features in the map. 
        To use the Find, select the type of geospatial feature to search in the Search By drop down and start typing in the field provided.
        Once you have entered enough characters (between 1 and 3), the search will begin listing values that match the search criteria. 
        To view one of the results, double click the result value in the result 
        list and the map will zoom to the location of the selected feature and highlight it.
        <br>
        <img style="width: 1132px; height: 779px;" alt="" src="../images/find.jpg">
        <br>
        
        The spatial searches available in SOLA Lesotho are:

    <ul>

        <li>Grid Number	Enter the grid number to locate a grid on the map. 
            Requires at lease 2 characters to be entered</li> 
        <li>Lessee name Enter the name of a current lessee to locate a plot. 
            This search will only work if the property is linked to a plot or subplot.
            This search will only work with plots that have a spatial definition. 
            Requires at least 3 characters to be entered.</li>

    </ul>

<h2>Information Tool</h2>

<p>The Information Tool can be used to query geospatial features such as
    parcels, survey control, place names, roads, villages, etc. As geospatial features are often
    in close proximity or overlap, the Information Tool displays details
    for all features immediately surrounding the selected location.
    Click the appropriate tab to see details for the various layer features.

<h2>Print out Tool</h2>
<p> The   <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/50_print_icon.png">
    Print Tool can be used to export the current view of the map to a PDF file 
    for printing. Before printing, you should setup the map with the layers you 
    want to include in the print by turning them on or off. Once you have 
    arranged the map with the information you want on the print, click the 
    <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/50_print_icon.png">
    Print Tool. This will display the Print dialog where you can select the 
    layout (A3, A4, A5) and change the map scale. 
</p><br>

<img style="width: 258px; height: 178px;" alt="" src="../images/printDialog.png">
<p> Click the Print button to generate a document containing the image of the map. 
    Using the Report Viewer, you can save the print in several formats including 
    PDF, DOCX and HTML or print a hard copy.

<h2>Export to KML Tool</h2>
<p> The   <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/65_export_kml_icon.png">
    Export to KML Tool can be used to export the currently selected feature of 
    the map into a basic format KML file. That KML file can then be loaded into 
    Google Earth and displayed. 

    Before exporting, you should use the Map Find to locate and select a feature 
    and then click the  
    <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/65_export_kml_icon.png">
    Export to KML Tool. This will export map data from the selection layer using 
    longitude and latitude coordinates into a file called mapExport.kml in your
    user_home/sola/ directory. If you have Google Earth installed, double click 
     the file to launch Google Earth and show the feature super-imposed on Google 
     Earth map. Note that you can also use Google Earth to change the styling for 
     the feature.

<h2>Changing the Coordinate System used by the Map</h2>
<p>
    Two coordinate systems are used in Lesotho, Cape / Lo27 covering the area from 
    26째 E to 28째 E and Cape / Lo29 covering the area from 28째 E to 30째 E. The 
    SOLA Map can be re-projected using either the Lo27 or Lo29 coordinate system 
    by selecting the applicable coordinate system in the combo box in the bottom 
    left of the map. 
    <br>
    
    The Coordinate Systems layer provides a visual reference showing the coordinate 
    system best suited for the area displayed on the map. Note that SOLA will not 
    automatically change the display coordinate system of the map. You must 
    change it manually.
