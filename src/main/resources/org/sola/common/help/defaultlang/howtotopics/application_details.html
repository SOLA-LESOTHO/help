        <p>An application represents a bundle of services that will be undertaken 
            by the land administration agency, typically in response to a client 
            request. Each service may result in changes to property information 
            and/or associated rights. Details that can be captured for an 
            application are: <br></p>

        <ul>

            <li>Agent &#8211; An individual or organization that is requesting 
                information or changes to the land registry and/or cadastre information 
                recorded in SOLA. This could be a lawyer or surveyor under instruction 
                from the property owner, the property owner themselves or a third 
                party with a vested interest in a particular property. Agent details 
                are optional. <br>   </li>
            <li>Contact Details &#8211; The individual that can be contacted should 
                the details of the application require further elaboration or 
                clarification. A contact person must be identified with every 
                application and will usually be the applicant.  <br></li>
            <li>Services &#8211; Used to control the type of change an application 
                can make to the land registry and/or cadastre information recorded 
                in SOLA. These broadly identify the actions the land administration 
                agency will undertake for the application. Refer to the Services 
                section of information on the services available for SOLA Lesotho. 
                At least one service must be added to each application. <br>  </li>
            <li>Documents &#8211; The legal or other documents that explain and/or 
                justify the reasons for changing land registry and/or cadastre information. Scanned images of documents should be attached to the application for easy reference. Document details are optional; however there are certain document types that are expected to accompany various services.  The Required Document Types list on the Documents tab identifies the types of documents that should be included with the application given the services that have been selected.  <br></li>
            <li>Plots &#8211; The plots or plots affected by the application. Plot 
                details are optional for new applications, but may be required prior 
                to starting services depending in the services selected for the application. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Properties &#8211; The property or properties affected by the application. 
                Property details are optional for new applications, but may be 
                required prior to starting services depending on the services selected 
                for the application.  <br></li>
            <li>Fees &#8211; TO BE DOCUMENTED  <br></li>
            <li>Validations &#8211; Displays the results of the automated business rules executed 
                when you choose to manually validate the application using the Validate action. 
                Validation is only available after the application has been lodged.<br></li>
            <li>History &#8211; Displays the history of actions applied to the application 
                and its services. The actions that can be applied to applications 
                and services are in the Application Lifecycle and Service Lifecycle 
                sections. History details are only available after the application 
                has been lodged. <br>
            </li>
