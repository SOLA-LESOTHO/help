        <h1>Record Title Survey</h1>

        <p>When a new Title Survey is submitted to LAA for approval the details 
            from the survey must be recorded in SOLA before the leases over any 
            new plots can be issued. Lodging the application will typically be 
            the responsibility of a Customer Service Representative, with Survey 
            Services responsible for assessing the new survey and recording the 
            survey details in SOLA. </p>
        
        <h2>Lodge an Application</h2>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
             <li>From the Dashboard, select the   
                <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/03_new_application_icon.png">
                New application tool to open the Application Details screen.  </li>
            <li>On the General tab, enter the contact details for the person 
                making the request and select the agent from the Agent drop down if appropriate.  </li>
            <li>On the Services tab, add the Change to Cadastre service to the application.</li>
            <li>On the Plot tab, search for any underlying plots of the plan 
                (i.e. the plots that will be extinguished by the plan) and add them 
                to the application. This step may not be required if there are no plots 
                to be extinguished by the plan. </li>
            <li>On the Documents tab, record each of the physical documents provided 
                by the person registering the POA. At a minimum the Change to 
                Cadastre service requires a Survey Report. </li>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Ensure you select the appropriate document type and record 
                    the document date (i.e. the date recorded on the face of the 
                    physical document) or todayâ€™ s date if the physical document is not dated. </li>
                <li>Enter a reference number for the document and a description. 
                    The reference number should be taken from the physical document. 
                    If the physical document does not have any reference number, 
                    then enter the application number, period and document 
                    sequence number (e.g. 120001.03). </li>
                <li>The Source Agency is the name of the organization that created 
                    the physical document. E.g. For the POA, this may be the name 
                    of the grantor. This field is optional and can be left blank</li>
                <li>d.	If you have scanned the document, use the Attachment field 
                    to link in the scanned image. If you have not yet scanned the 
                    document, you will need to do this at a later stage and link it 
                    into the document using the Edit Document functionality available 
                    from Document Search. </li>
            </ol>
            <li>Click the <img style="width: 20px; height: 21px;" alt="" src="../images/save_icon.png">
                Save button. This will lodge the application and produce the lodgement 
                notice. Print the notice and give it to the surveyor (or their representative)
                as proof the application has been lodged. The lodgement notice will
                indicate the fee to pay for the application.  </li>
         </ol>
       

        <h2>Fee Payment</h2>
        
        <p>TO BE REVISED</p>
        
        <p>Once the lodgement notice is printed, the person will need to take the 
            notice to the cashier and arrange payment. When payment has been made, 
            the cashier will locate the Unassigned application list on the SOLA Dashboard, 
            <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/51_open.png">
            Open the application and check the Fee Paid flag on the Fees tab to 
            indicate the application can continue processing./p>

        <h2>Assign the Application</h2>
        
        <p>Before work can begin on recording the survey information in SOLA, 
            the application must first get assigned to a Survey Services staff member. 
            Assignment of the application indicates that work on the survey is underway.</p>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>From the SOLA Dashboard, check the Unassigned applications list 
                to confirm the fee for the application has been paid. If the fee 
                has not been paid it will not be possible to assign the application. 
                In this situation notify the person noted as the contact and/or cashier 
                to confirm the payment status for the application </li>
            <li>If the application fee has been paid, select the application in 
                the Unassigned applications list and click the   
                <img style="width: 68px; height: 20px;" alt="" src="../images/06_assign_icon.png">
                Assign tool. This will open the Application Assignment dialog.   </li>
            <li>Click the Assign button to assign the application. When the Assign 
                action is complete, you will be returned to the Dashboard and the 
                assigned application will appear in your Assigned applications list.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Typically users will only be able to assign applications to themselves 
            (i.e. they will be able to pull work), however team leaders will be able 
            to manage the workload of their teams and will be able to assign and 
            reassign applications to other users. Note that the
            <img style="width: 81px; height: 23px;" alt="" src="../images/08_unassign_icon.png">
           and <img style="width: 68px; height: 20px;" alt="" src="../images/06_assign_icon.png">
           tools can be used reassign the application to another user if necessary.  </p>
        
        <h2>Manual Assessment</h2>
        
        <p>The Survey staff member assigned to the application will perform the 
            necessary manual checks to confirm the survey complies with the appropriate 
            survey regulations. If the assessment of the survey is successful, the 
            staff member can begin recording the details of the survey in SOLA using 
            the Change to Cadastre service. If the assessment reveals issues with 
            the survey that must be addressed by the surveyor, then the survey will 
            need to be placed on hold until the necessary information is provided. </p>
        
        <h2>Holding and Resubmitting the Survey</h2>
        
        <p>When the survey requires further information from the surveyor, it will 
            be necessary to update the application in SOLA to the On Hold status.</p>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        
        <p>You use the Document Registration screen to register the POA></p>

        
        <ol>
            <li>Confirm that the survey will require further information 
                from the surveyor with the appropriate team leader.  </li>
            <li>Create the notice describing the issues that need to be addressed by the surveyor.   </li> 
            <li>Open the application from the Assigned applications list in the Dashboard. 
                Go to the Documents tab and create a document and attach the notice to it.  
                Attaching the notice to the application will ensure the reasons for 
                placing the plan on hold are recorded in SOLA. </li>
            <li>Using the Application action dropdown, select the 
                <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/hold_icon.png">
                Hold action. This will update the application status to On Hold 
                and remove the application from your Assigned applications list. 
                If the Hold action is not enabled on the Application action dropdown, 
                confirm the application is assigned to you and that you have the 
                Hold/Requisition Application role by asking IT Services to check 
                your SOLA User setup. 
                <p><img style="width: 123px; height: 186px;" alt="" src="../images/application_action_dropdown.png"></p><br>
            <li>Dispatch the notice to the surveyor so that they are aware of the 
                items that must be addressed. You can record that when the notice 
                is sent by using the 
                <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/dispatch_icon.png">
                 Dispatch action of the Application action dropdown. </li>
            <p>Once the surveyor addresses the items listed in the notice, they will resubmit the survey. </p>
            
            <li>Use the <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/04_search_icon.png">
                Application search to locate the application for the survey and
                <img style="width: 19px; height: 23px;" alt="" src="../images/51_open.png">
                Open it.           </li>
            <li>Select the 
            <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/resubmit_icon.png">
            Resubmit action on the Application action dropdown. This will move the 
            application back to the Assigned applications list ready for further processing.  </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>It is possible the surveyor may choose to withdraw the survey. 
            This can be achieved by using the 
            <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/withdraw_icon.png">
            Withdraw action on the Application action dropdown. Alternatively, if the 
            survey remains on hold for an extended period, and no further information 
            is provided by the surveyor, the application can be lapsed using the
            <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/lapse_icon.png">
            Lapse action.  Be aware that once lapsed or withdrawn, the survey 
            cannot be reinstated.  </p>
        
        <h2>Change to Cadastre Service</h2>
        
        <p>The Change to Cadastre service provides tools that allow you to modify 
            the existing cadastral network. The following describes the basic process 
            flow for capturing survey information. Variations to this basic flow 
            are possible.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Steps</h3> 
        
        <ol>
            <li>From the Dashboard,
                <img style="width: 55px; height: 21px;" alt="" src="../images/51_open.png">
                Open the application from your Assigned applications list. </li>
            <li>On the Services tab, select the Change to Cadastre service and click the
               <img style="width: 21px; height: 22px;" alt="" src="../images/start_again_icon.png">
               Start tool. This will open the Change to Cadastre screen.  </li>
            <li>If the Map Viewer is not already zoomed to the location of the survey, 
                use the map search or the map navigation tools to locate the area 
                of the survey.  </li>
            <li>Use the Select Target Plot tool 
               <img style="width: 21px; height: 18px;" alt="" src="../images/24_target_parcel_icon.png">
               to select (or deselect) the underlying parcels as required. <b>Note</b>: 
               To subdivide or amalgamate existing plots, you must use the Select 
               Target Plot tool to identify the existing plots that are being 
               subdivided or amalgamated. If the new plot(s) will be over previously 
               unsurveyed areas, it will not be necessary for you to use the Select 
               Target Plot tool unless you use it to assist with node linking to 
               plots beside the new plot. When used for node linking purposes you 
               must deselect the target plots before completing the Change to Cadastre service. </li>
            <li>If you have an image of the survey plan, you can choose 
                to add the plan image into the Map Viewer to assist with digitizing coordinates. </li>
            <li>Capture the survey points for the plan. You can do this by using 
                the Create / Link Survey Points tool
                <img style="width: 21px; height: 13px;" alt="" src="../images/26_survey_points_tool_icon.png">
                to locate survey points directly on the Map Viewer using the mouse, 
                load new coordinates from a survey data file or use the Survey Points 
                screen to manually enter the new coordinate details.   </li> 
            <li>Use the Create / Link Survey Points tool 
                <img style="width: 21px; height: 13px;" alt="" src="../images/26_survey_points_tool_icon.png">
                to link survey points that represent existing marks to the appropriate 
                target plot nodes. This step is important because it ties the new 
                survey data to the underlying cadastral network. Once linked, a 
                survey point will change from being a blue plus to a green plus.  </li>
            <li>Use the Survey Points screen to identify any traverse points 
                from the plan by de-selecting/unchecking the Is boundary checkbox.  </li>
            <li>Create the new plots from the plan using the Create New Plot tool
                <img style="width: 24px; height: 20px;" alt="" src="../images/27_new_parcel_icon.png">
                New plots will automatically get assigned the appropriate plot 
                number when they are saved. </li>
            <li>Use the Plot List tool
               <img style="width: 24px; height: 21px;" alt="" src="../images/28_parcel_list_icon.png">
               to open the Plot List screen and print the S.10 Survey Approval form 
               so that it can be signed and forwarded to the surveyor.  </li>
            <li>Once all of the relevant information from the survey has been captured 
                into SOLA, return to the Services tab of the Application Details 
                screen, select the Change to Cadastre service and click the
               <img style="width: 19px; height: 23px;" alt="" src="../images/complete_icon.png">
               Complete tool. This will run the SOLA business rules to validate 
               the application data. If there is a critical failure, you must 
               remedy the failure as it will not be possible to approve the 
               application otherwise. </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Use <img style="width: 20px; height: 21px;" alt="" src="../images/save_icon.png">
                Save on the Change to Cadastre screen regularly. </li>
            <li>The act of saving and/or completing the service will cause the 
                SOLA business rules to run validating the state of the data. 
                If you receive rule failures, check 
                <a href="business_rules.html" target="_top">Business Rules</a>

       <h2>Approving the Survey</h2>
       
       <p>The changes you make to the cadastral network while recording new survey 
           information remain pending until the application is approved. Survey 
           approval in SOLA can be achieved using the 
           <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/approve_application_icon.png">
           Approve action in the Application action dropdown.   </p>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        
        <ol>
           <li>Open the application from your Assigned applications list and use the 
               <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/validate_icon.png">
                Validate tool to check the status of the application data. If 
                there are any rule failures, review the application data and correct 
                the issues as appropriate before proceeding to approve the application.  </li>  
            <li>Use the <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/approve_application_icon.png">
                Approve action in the Application action dropdown to approve the application.
                This will update the status of the application to Approved as well 
                as update the cadastral network with the information captured from the survey.       </li>
            <li>Dispatch a notice and any other relevant information to the surveyor 
                to notify them of the approval. You can record that when the notice 
                is sent by using the
