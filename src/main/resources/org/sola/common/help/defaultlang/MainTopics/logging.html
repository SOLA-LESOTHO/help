        <h1>Logging</h1>
        
        <p>From time to time you may encounter unexpected issues while trying to 
            run SOLA. Usually the error message will recommend a course of action, 
            but occasionally you may encounter a technical issue that requires further 
            investigation by the IT Support Team or another SOLA technical person. 
            To assist that investigation you may be asked to provide a copy of the 
            log files supporting SOLA. The logs capture exception information and 
            status messages that can help a technical person to determine the cause 
            of a particular issue.</p>
        
        
        <p>This section describes the two types of logs available with SOLA; the 
            SOLA Application Logs and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) logging. It 
            also describes how to access information from those logs. </p>
        
        <h2>Java Runtime Environment (JRE) Logging</h2>
        
        <p>Each SOLA Web Start application (i.e. SOLA Desktop and SOLA Admin) 
            creates an application log file on your local computer to capture 
            exceptions and various status messages. You can find those log files 
            at the following directory location <b>User Home Directory>/sola/logs</b>. </p>
        
        <p>The name of the log file will be DesktopApplication_<date>.log (for SOLA 
            Desktop) or AdminApplication_<date>.log (for SOLA Admin). Simply open 
            the appropriate log and copy the text from the log file into your 
            email reply or issue ticket. </p>
            
        <p>JRE Logging is <b>not</b> turned on by default. You need to use the Java Control 
            Panel to turn on the Java Console which can then be used to turn on 
            JRE Logging as required. To turn on the Java Console and JRE Logging</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>From the Control Panel, choose the <b>Java</b> icon.</li>
            <li>On the Java Control Panel, click the Advanced tab and expand the 
                <b>Java console</b> node to select the <b>Show console</b> option.</li>
            <li>Click the OK button to close the Java Control Panel and save changes.

            <li>Start the SOLA Web Start application by double clicking the appropriate 
                desktop shortcut. You will notice the Java Console display along 
                with the SOLA login page.</li>
            <li>Click the Java Console so that it has focus and press <b>5</b>. 
                The message <b>Trace level set to 5: all ...completed</b> should 
                display in the console. Pressing 5 turns on logging to its maximum level.

            <li>As you use the SOLA application, messages will be output 
                to the console. Repeat the actions that cause the issue to occur.</li>
            <li>After successfully repeating the issue, click the <b>Copy</b> button on the Java Console and paste the contents of the JRE log into your email reply or issue ticket. </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Be aware that JRE Logging will only be turned on for the duration of 
            your current session. If you restart the SOLA Web Start application, 
            JRE Logging will be turned off until you set the logging level in the 
            Java Console. </p>
