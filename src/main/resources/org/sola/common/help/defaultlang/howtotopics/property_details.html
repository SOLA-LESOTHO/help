            or groups (i.e. parties) that hold those rights. The information represented 
            by the property is often referred to as the Title. Details that can be 
            captured for a property include: <br></p>
        <ul>
            
            <li>Plot &#8211; Details about the plot the property represents.  <br>

                holder(s) are accorded in relation to the plot represented by the

                rights, mortgages, servitudes, etc

                the property. The Lease Holder tab is intended to provide quick

                details must be captured on the Lease right in the Rights / Restrictions 
                tab using the appropriate service <br>
            </li>
            <li>Notations &#8211; Short comments recorded when changes are made 
                to the property that provides a succinct history of the changes.

                superseded by when the property (or lease) was terminated.  <br>

                the property if one exists. This can help to identify the location 
                of the property.   <br>
            </li>
        </ul>
