<h1>Assign an Application<br>
</h1>

<p>To assign an application, you must first ensure the Paid flag on the Services 
    tab is checked. If you have permission to set the Paid flag, you can do this 
    by editing the application and checking the Paid checkbox on the Services tab. 
    Make sure to

    list and click the 
    <img style="width: 20px; height: 21px;" alt="" src="../images/06_assign_icon.png">
    tool. This will open the Application Assignment dialog. Your name should be 
    the default selection in the Assignee drop down.  Click the

<p>Typically users will only be able to assign applications to themselves (i.e. 
    they will be able to pull work), however team leaders will be able to manage 
    the workload of their teams and will be able to assign and reassign applications 
    to other users by selecting the appropriate user from the Assignee drop down list.  </p>

<p>If you need to bulk assign applications to the same user, simply check all of 
    the applications you wish to assign before clicking the 
     <img style="width: 20px; height: 21px;" alt="" src="../images/06_assign_icon.png">
    tool</p>
