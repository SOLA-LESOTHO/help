        <h1>Solutions for Open Land Administration (SOLA)</h1>

        <p>In December 2012, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
            successfully concluded the Solutions for Open Land Administration (SOLA) project. 
            The 2.5 year project was funded by the Government of Finland and dedicated to 
            implementing an open source computerised cadastre and registration system that 
            is both affordable and sustainable in the context of developing countries. The 
            open source software produced by the SOLA project (also called SOLA) is based 
            on international good practice for service delivery, responsible governance of 
            tenure (including transparency of process and transparency of tenure details), 
            robust data management and the need for enterprise scale software. 
            The underlying data structures used by the SOLA software are also based on the 
            Land Administration Domain Model (LADM), currently published as the ISO 19152 
            International Standard by the International Organization for Standardization 
            (ISO). </p>

       <p> As the laws and practices governing land administration are often unique to a 
           given country, SOLA was designed to be customisable so that it could appropriately 
           reflect the laws and practices of the host country. To test the effectiveness of 
           the software and the approach used for customisation, the SOLA project included 
           three pilot implementations in Ghana, Nepal and Samoa. Each pilot implementation 
           was undertaken by a team of local software developers who were first trained by 
           an FAO SOLA Mentor so they could undertake the required customizations, support 
           the pilot implementations and maintain the software. Each pilot presented its 
           own challenges with many lessons learned by the FAO SOLA Team along the way. 
           Although customisation of the software was completed for all three pilots, Samoa 
           is the only country that has so far deployed SOLA in support of their day to day 
           land administration activities with Nepal expected to follow suit in the near future.  </p>

        <p> Customization of the initial generic SOLA software is needed to cater for the laws, 
            existing records and practices of each country where SOLA is implemented as well as to accommodate 
            the specific responsibilities of the land administration agency that will use SOLA in support of their 
            cadastre and registration functions. To assist the customization process, local software developers 
            have been recruited and trained so they can undertake the required customizations, 
            support the pilot implementations and maintain the software. 
            The local software development teams are expected to become key members of the SOLA user and developer community. </p>

        <h2>Continued Support for SOLA</h2>

        <p>Since the completion of the SOLA project, interest in SOLA has continued to grow 
            with several new countries now undertaking SOLA customisations. Those countries 
            include Tonga, Lesotho and two implementations (for two states) in Nigeria. 
            These new implementations have been made possible with the help of development 
            assistance donors including the South Pacific Subregional Office of FAO, the 
            Millennium Challenge Account – Lesotho (MCA-L),  Adam Smith International and 
            the Department for International Development (DFID) UK.</p>
        
        <p> FAO also continues to support SOLA through the assistance available to countries 
            wanting to implement the Voluntary Guidelines on Responsible Governance of Tenure. 
            In this new context, SOLA is seen as an excellent example of an enabling technology
            that improves transparency and service delivery in land administration agencies 
            – key elements to improve land tenure governance. Several new modules have also 
            been proposed that are complementary to the cadastral and land registration 
            functions already supported by SOLA. Those modules include: </p>

        <ul>

            <li>Lease Management  </li>
            <li>State Land Management </li>
            <li>Mass Property Appraisal/Valuation</li>
            <li>Cadastral Quality Assurance (Plan Examination)</li>
            <li>An interface and repository for community recording of land rights (crowd sourcing)</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Development of these new modules will be dependent on the requirements of 
            new countries undertaking SOLA implementations, however new funding is also 
            being sought to accelerate the development of the modules within the generic 
            SOLA product.  </p> <br>
