<h1>Lodge an Application for Registration Services</h1>

<p>When a customer submits a completed application form requesting a registration 
    service from the LAA such as a registration of mortgage, registration of servitude 
    or registration of notarial bond, etc., it will be the responsibility of a 
    Customer Services Representative to lodge an application within SOLA so that 
    the appropriate updates can be made. </p>

<h2>Lodge an Application</h2>

<p>Lodging the application should be done while the agent or applicant is in 
    attendance so that you can provide them with the lodgement notice.  <br>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>From the Dashboard select the 
            <img style="width: 49px; height: 23px;" alt="" src="../images/52_add_icon.png">
            New application tool to open the Application Details screen.</li>
    <li>On the General tab, enter the contact details for the person making
                the request and select the agent from the Agent drop down if appropriate. </li>
    <li>On the Services tab,  <img style="width: 49px; height: 23px;" alt="" src="../images/52_add_icon.png">
        Add the service that matches the registration service requested by the customer.</li>
    <li>Where the registration service is to transact over a registered property 
        (e.g. Register Mortgage, Cancel Sublease, etc.), go to the Properties tab 
        and search for the property that will be affected.  Once you have located 
        the property, <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/complete_icon.png">
        Select it to link it to the application.</li>
    <li>On the Documents tab, record each of the physical documents provided by the 
        customer. The documents required are dependent on the service(s) selected. 
        When capturing document information</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Ensure you select the appropriate document type and record 
                the document date (i.e. the date recorded on the face of the physical 
                document) or todayâ€™ s date if the physical document is not dated</li>
            <li>Enter a reference number for the document and a description. 
                The reference number should be taken from the physical document. 
                If the physical document does not have any reference number, then 
                enter the application number (if known)</li>
            <li>The Source Agency is the name of the organization that created the 
                physical document. For example, this could be the bank for mortgage 
                documents, or the agents firm details for agreements and other 
                document types. This field is optional and can be left blank. </li>
            <li>If you have scanned the document, use the Attachment field to link 
                in the scanned image. IMPORTANT: If you have not yet scanned the 
                document, you will need to do this at a later stage and link it into 
                the document using the Edit Document functionality available from 
                Document Search. </li>
        </ol>
    <li>Click the <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/save_icon.png">
        Save button. This will lodge the application and produce the lodgement notice. 
        Print the notice and give it to the customer as proof the application has 
        been lodged. The lodgement notice will indicate the fee to be paid for the application. </li>

</ol>   
<br>
<h3>Fee Payment</h3>

    to the cashier and arrange payment. When payment has been made, the cashier will
