        <h1>Business Rules</h1>

        <p>SOLA employs business rules to automatically validate the data entered 
            by a user to ensure consistency of the data as well as warning the user 
            of potential irregularities. Business rules are usually executed just 
            prior to changes in state of an application or a service (e.g. 
            application approval) but can also be manually triggered using the 
            Validation tool in the Application Details screen.</p>
        <br>
        <p>All business rules have a severity rating and the failure of any 
            critical business rule will cause the current action to be aborted. 
            In this situation, the user will be required to remedy the issue 
            reported by the failed critical rule(s) before processing can continue. <br></p>
        
        <p>The results of the business rules are displayed in the Business Rule 
            Feedback popup. Each row in the Feedback popup represents a business 
            rule that has been executed by the validation process. The first 
            column is a message that describes the business rule from the perspective 
            that the business rule passes. The last column contains either a green 
            traffic light icon repressing a pass of the business rule or a red 
            traffic light representing a fail. The severity rating for each 
            business rule is also listed. As noted above, any critical fails 
            from an automated validation will prevent the current process from 
            completing until the critical fail has been remedied. Other severity 
            fails will not abort the current action allowing the process to complete.
            <br></p>
        <p>The default ordering of the validation checks is for fails to appear at 
            the top ordered by severity.

            Where possible, business rules are defined in such a way that if they 
            are irrelevant to a particular situation, they are excluded and do not 
            appear in the Feedback popup. Sometimes the complexity of a business 
            rule prevents this screening process and you may find business rules 
            listed that are not particularly relevant to the current situation. 
            Similarly, not all business rules can be automated and so this form 
            of checking should not be considered the only checking method. However, 
            if you identify a new business rule that you think could be automated, 
            contact the SOLA support team with details. <br></p>
        <p>A complete listing of all business rules including what remedial action 
            should be taken is included in 
            <a href="../MainTopics/sola_business_rules.html" target="_top">SOLA Business Rules</a>
