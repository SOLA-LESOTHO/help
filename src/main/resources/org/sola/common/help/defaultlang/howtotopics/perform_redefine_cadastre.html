        <h1>Perform a Redefinition of Cadastre</h1>

        <p>You can perform a redefinition of cadastre by adding a Redefine Cadastre service to an application. When the service is started, the Redefine screen will be display. Select the appropriate target parcels and enter new nodes using the Add a Node tool or select existing nodes the Select a Node to Change tool and change the coordinates entering them directly into the opened dialog box and click modify. You can also click remove thus deleting the node.
            Once modified the coordinates or removed the node you can reset the cadastre definition process using the Reset tool.
            When the redefinition is complete, Save the cadastre redefinition.
            To complete the cadastre redefinition, complete the Redefine Cadastre service using the Complete tool on the Application Details Services tab and then approve the application. This will cause the new pending parcels to become current and the target parcels to become historic
