        <h1>Terminate Lease</h1>

        <p>Leases may be terminated by court order or other legal instruction. 
            The process for Terminate a Lease is similar to that for Surrender a 
            Lease with the exception that there is no need to print the Lease 
            Surrender letter. </p>
        
        <p>Refer to the Surrender a Lease section for details.   </p>
