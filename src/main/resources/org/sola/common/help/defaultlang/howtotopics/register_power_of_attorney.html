        <h1>Register Power of Attorney</h1>

            a person (attorney) to act on behalf of another (grantor) in private 
            affairs, business or some other legal matter. Once registered, the 
            Power of Attorney can be associated to any application to support 
            property transactions made under the Power of Attorney. </p>
