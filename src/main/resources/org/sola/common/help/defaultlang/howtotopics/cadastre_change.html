<h1>Change to Cadastre</h1>

<p>The Change to Cadastre screen allows you to create new plots and subplots for 
    lease purposes. The details for new plots can be obtained from a survey plan 
    either by heads up digitizing from an image of the plan or by entering the 
    coordinates for survey points. The Change to Cadastre screen can be accessed by 
    <img style="width: 21px; height: 22px;" alt="" src="../images/start_again_icon.png">
    starting the Change to Cadastre service from the Application Details Service tab.
</p><br>

<img style="width: 790px; height: 510px;" alt="" src="../images/23_cadastre_change.png"><br>

<p>The Change to Cadastre screen extends the SOLA Map Viewer with additional tools 
    to aid spatial editing of plots. The additional tools provided are:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Select / Deselect Target Parcel <img style="width: 21px; height: 18px;" alt="" src="../images/24_target_parcel_icon.png"></li>
  <li>Survey Points screen <img style="width: 18px; height: 18px;" alt="" src="../images/25_survey_points_list_icon.png"></li>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Selecting the Coordinate System</h2>
<p>Before capturing new plot details you must determine the coordinate system to 
    use (either Lo27 or Lo29) and set it on the Map. This will ensure all data 
    captured will be stored using the coordinate system you have chosen. Be aware 
    that you may need to set the coordinate system every time you open the Map to 
    capture new plot information. </p>

<h2>Target Plots</h2>
<p>Target plots are used to indicate the underlying plots that are being subdivided 
    or amalgamated by a survey plan. Most survey plans in Lesotho identify new areas 
    of land that have not previously been surveyed, so it will usually not be 
    necessary to select target plots. 
</p>   
<p>    In cases where the survey plan does indicate that one or more underlying plots
    are being subdivided or amalgamated, first locate the underlying plots on the 
    map using the map search or the map navigation tools. Once located, use the 
    Select / Deselect Target Plot tool
    <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/24_target_parcel_icon.png">
    to select (or deselect) plots as required. Target plots will display with a 
    dark blue border and light yellow fill. 
</p>
<p>    Target plots may also be used to assist with snapping a survey point for a 
    new plot to the node of an adjacent plot. To do this, use the Select / Deselect 
    Target Plot tool 
     <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/24_target_parcel_icon.png">
    to select the existing plot that will share a boundary node with the new plot. 
    Add the new survey point to the map and snap it to the appropriate node on 
    the target plot. Once you have completed snapping the new survey points to 
    the existing plot nodes, you must deselect the target plots. 

</p>
<p>    WARNING: Failing to deselect a target plot after you have completed snapping 
    of the new survey points will cause the target plot to be removed from the map 
    when the application is approved.

</p>

<h2>Survey Points</h2>

<p>Survey points represent coordinates recorded on a survey plan. They can be located 
    directly on the map via a single click with the Create / Link Survey Points tool 
    <img style="width: 21px; height: 13px;" alt="" src="../images/26_survey_points_tool_icon.png">
    loaded from a survey data file or the coordinates can be manually entered using 
    the Survey Points screen which can be accessed using the Survey Points tool
    <img style="width: 18px; height: 18px;" alt="" src="../images/25_survey_points_list_icon.png">
</p> <br>

<img style="width: 630px; height: 324px;" alt="" src="../images/29_survey_points.png"><br>

<p>By default, new survey points are created as boundary points. You can change 
    a survey point to a traverse point by clearing the Is boundary checkbox. 
    Traverse points are displayed on the map as red triangles. 
</p>

<p>You can also link a boundary point to the node of a target plot using the 
    Create / Link Survey Points tool
    <img style="width: 21px; height: 13px;" alt="" src="../images/26_survey_points_tool_icon.png">
    Simply select the new boundary point and drag it close to the target plot node. 
    The new boundary point will snap to the location of the target plot node and 
    the blue cross will change to a green cross to confirm the linkage. The Survey 
    Points screen also indicates when the boundary point is linked. To unlink the 
    boundary point, clear the Is linked check box.
    
</p>
<p>If you need to delete a survey point that has been added in error, select the 
    point from the list and click the Remove button.
</p>
 
<p>    Coordinate data can also be loaded from a Comma Separated Values (CSV) text 
    file. Loading a CSV coordinate file requires attaching a .csv file as a document 
    to the application and using the Add Points button on the Documents tab of 
    Change to Cadastre to import the data. For details on the file format and the 
    steps required to import a survey data file see Import a Survey Data File.

</p> <br>

<h2>Heads up Digitizing</h2>

    <p>To assist capturing the location of survey points from the plan, you can 
        load an image of the survey plan onto the Map Viewer and use the mouse to 
        capture the location of the new survey points. 
</p>
<p>        To add a plan image to the map you must first have an image file available 
        on your local hard drive. The file formats supported by the Map Viewer are 
        TIFF, PNG and JPEG. If you have an image in a different format (e.g. PDF), 
        then you will need to convert the file to one of the accepted image formats 
        before it can be displayed in the Map Viewer.
</p>
<p>        The Add Image tool
        <img style="width: 32px; height: 23px;" alt="" src="../images/58_add_image_icon.png">
       works by matching two points you select on the map with two points you select 
       from the image. For the best match accuracy, the first node you select should 
       be at the bottom left of the plan image and the second point at the top 
       right (or top left and bottom right). The image is then scaled and displayed 
       in the Map Viewer accordingly. 
</p>
<p>       Note that the current Add image tool does not rotate the image and requires 
       the plan to have a standard North orientation. If the plan does not have 
       a standard North orientation, use an appropriate imaging software package 
       (e.g. Microsoft Office Picture Manager) to rotate the plan image so that 
       North for the plan is the top of the computer screen before adding the 
       image to the map. 
</p>
    
    <h2>Creating New Plots</h2>
    <p>You can create new plots using the Create New Plot tool  . Using the tool, 
        single click each survey point of the new plot in sequence in either a 
        clockwise or anti-clockwise direction and double click on the final survey 
        point to close the plot boundary. You will then be prompted with the Plot 
        properties dialog. <br>
        <br>
 <img style="width: 600px; height: 362px;" alt="" src="../images/plot_properties_dialog.png"><br>
 
    </p>
 
    <p>   
     Enter the appropriate details for the new plot. The most important 
        information is the Type. In most cases this should be set to Parcel which 
        will indicate the record is a new plot. Save the details when you have 
        finished entering them and the map will redraw showing the new plot with 
        a green border and yellow fill.  <br>
        <br>
        <img style="width: 790px; height: 510px;" alt="" src="../images/31_new_parcels.png"><br>
 </p>
 
 <p>If you make a mistake while forming the new parcel, right click to 
        cancel the shape and start again. 
 </p>
    <h2>Plot Numbering</h2>
    <p>
       Plots are assigned a sequential number based on the grid in which they are 
       located. You will note in the previous screen shot that the new plot is 
       temporarily assigned the number tmp-2. SOLA will automatically assign the 
       appropriate number for the new plot (or subplot) when you 
       <img style="width: 20px; height: 21px;" alt="" src="../images/save_icon.png">
       Save the Change to Cadastre. <br>
       <br>
       <img style="width: 790px; height: 510px;" alt="" src="../images/plots_with_assigned_numbers.png"><br>
      
    </p>
    
    <h2>Editing or Removing a New Plot</h2>
    <p>If you need to further update the details for the new plot, use the Plot List tool 
       <img style="width: 24px; height: 21px;" alt="" src="../images/28_parcel_list_icon.png">
     to open the Plot List screen. From here you can select the plot and  
      <img style="width: 50px; height: 20px;" alt="" src="../images/53_edit_icon.png">
     its details as required using the Plot properties dialog. Once you have completed 
     your updates in the Plot properties dialog,
     <img style="width: 20px; height: 21px;" alt="" src="../images/save_icon.png">
     Save and Close to redisplay the Plot List screen or 
     <img style="width: 20px; height: 21px;" alt="" src="../images/cancel_icon.png">
     Cancel if you choose not to save your changes.
    </p>

     <p>
     If you decide to remove the new plot, select it in the Plot List screen and choose
      <img style="width: 26px; height: 25px;" alt="" src="../images/62_reset_changes.png">
     Remove You can also print an S-10 Survey Approval form by choosing 
      <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/50_print_icon.png">
     Print S.10 Form on the Plot List screen.<br>
     <br>
       <img style="width: 670px; height: 478px;" alt="" src="../images/32_parcel_list.png"><br>
    
    </p>
    <h2>Creating Plots with Irregular Boundaries</h2>
    <p>The Create New Plot tool allows you to create new plots with simple right-line 
        boundaries where the start and end point for each boundary line must be 
        a survey point. If the plot requires an irregular boundary (a.k.a. natural 
        boundary) then you need to use the Boundary Change tools to modify the 
        right line boundary line of a new plot.  
        <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/27_new_parcel_icon.png">
        prior to using the Boundary Change tools. The exception to this rule is where 
        the irregular boundary will form the shoreline of a lake or the sea. 
        In this case it is unlikely there will be an adjacent parcel to update. 
        </p>
        <p>The Select Boundary tool
        <img style="width: 23px; height: 25px;" alt="" src="../images/56_select_boundary_icon.png">
       can be used to identify the boundary line(s) of a new plot that must be 
       changed into an irregular boundary. Use the tool to select the start and 
       end points of the irregular boundary by dragging a small selection box 
       around the appropriate new parcel node when prompted to do so by the tool. <br>
        </p>
       <p>
      <img style="" alt="" src="../images/select_plot_node.png"><br>
      <br>
      The order that you select the start and end points for the new irregular 
      boundary is important. The tool will highlight all plot boundary line(s) 
      in a clockwise direction from the start point to the end point. The highlighted 
      boundary lines indicate the boundary lines that will be replaced by the new 
      irregular boundary. If the wrong sequence of boundary lines is highlighted, 
      repeat the selection ensuring the end point is selected as the start point 
      and vice versa. 
      
      </p>
      
      <p>Selecting a boundary to change will enable the Change Boundary tool 
      <img style="width: 27px; height: 28px;" alt="" src="../images/57_modify_boundary_icon.png">
      Use this tool to reshape the parcel boundary using the mouse. <br>
      <br>
      <img style="width: 790px; height: 510px;" alt="" src="../images/irregular_plot_boundary.png"><br>
       If the new boundary covers a large area, it can be difficult using the 
       Change Boundary tool
       <img style="width: 27px; height: 28px;" alt="" src="../images/57_modify_boundary_icon.png">
       to create the new boundary in one go. In this situation, create an initial 
       boundary that approximately represents the new boundary you require. You 
       can then zoom in and use the Boundary Change tools to improve segments of 
       the initial boundary as required. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Approving a Plan</h2>
    <p>Changes made to the cadastre remain pending until the application containing 
        the Change to Cadastre service is approved. You can approve the application 
        by completing all services on the application and approving the application 
        using the Approve tool.
        <br>
      <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/approve_application_icon.png">
      in the Application action dropdown. The new plots will then show as current 
      parcels in the SOLA Map Viewer. 
 </p>
 
 <p>     To print an S.10 Survey Approval Form for the new plot, use the Plot List tool
      <img style="width: 24px; height: 21px;" alt="" src="../images/28_parcel_list_icon.png">
      to open the Plot List screen and print the S.10 form from there. This can be 
      done before the application is approved. <br>
      <br>
      <img style="width: 790px; height: 510px;" alt="" src="../images/approved_plan.png"><br>    
    </p>
    <h2>Creating Subplots</h2>
    <p>You can create a subplot to define the area of a sublease in much the same 
        way as creating a plot. The main difference is to select Subplot instead 
        of Parcel as the Type on the Plot properties dialog.<br>
        <br>
         <img style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" alt="" src="../images/create_subplot.png"><br>
         <br>
         Subplots must be within the boundary of their parent plot. This may require 
         selecting the parent plot as a Target Plot temporarily so that node linking 
         can be performed.  This will help to avoid the subplot from extending beyond 
         the boundary of the parent plot. 
    </p>
    <p>WARNING: Be sure to deselect the Target Plot before completing the 
         Cadastre Change service otherwise the parent plot will be removed from 
         the map when the application is approved.  
    </p>
    <p>A plot can have more than one subplot, as long as the subplots do not 
         overlap. As with plots, the number for a subplot is automatically assigned 
         when the Cadastre Change is saved. You can also create irregular boundaries 
         for subplots in the same way as for plots.<br>

        <br>
        <img style="width: 790px; height: 510px;" alt="" src="../images/plot_with_two_subplots.png"><br>    

        <br>
        <br>Once the application is approved, the new subplots will display in the Subplots 
        layer of the Map.<br> 
        <br>
