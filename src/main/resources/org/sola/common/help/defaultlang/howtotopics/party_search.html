<h1>Party Search</h1>
<p>The Party Search screen allows you to locate parties which include both people 
    (Natural Person) and organizations/groups (Non-natural Person) that are associated 
    to property or property transactions. You can also add, edit, remove or view 
    party details from this screen. It can be accessed by selecting 
    <img style="width: 25px; height: 21px;" alt="" src="../images/49_person_icon.jpg">
    Party or Search > Party.
</p>

</p>
<p>You can search by any combination of Name, Type and Role. The Name also supports 
    partial and full matching.  SOLA makes no attempt to automatically link or 
    de-duplicate new party records. This can result in an individual or organization/group 
    being listed multiple times in the search results. 

    <br>The Is right holder flag indicates whether the party has a direct association 
    to a property as an owner or as a named party for another property right. 
    Parties that are flagged as right holders cannot be edited or removed using 
    this screen. Instead changes to the right holder details can only be made 
    using the appropriate service. 

    <br>Using this screen you can add a new party by clicking 
     <img style="width: 49px; height: 23px;" alt="" src="../images/52_add_icon.png">
      Add or edit existing parties that are not flagged as right holders by 
      selecting a search result and clicking 
     <img style="width: 50px; height: 20px;" alt="" src="../images/53_edit_icon.png">
     Both actions will open the Persons Details screen allowing you to enter details 
     for an individual or an entity. It is also possible to add new parties as well 
     as edit parties using other functions in SOLA such as contact persons, property 
     owners and right holders. 

     <br>To remove an existing party, select it and click
     <img style="width: 75px; height: 21px;" alt="" src="../images/54_remove_icon.png"> 
     Remove. If the party is not linked as an agent, property owner or right holder, 
     the record will be removed. 
     If you simply need to view the party details, select it and click 
     <img style="width: 62px; height: 23px;" alt="" src="../images/55_view_icon.png">
     View.
