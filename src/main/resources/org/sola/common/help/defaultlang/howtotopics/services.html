        <h1>Services</h1>
        
        <p> Services are a key component of SOLA as they control the changes that 
            can be made to the land register and cadastre information maintained 
            by SOLA. Every application lodged in SOLA must include at least one 
            service. In cases where several changes to the land registry or cadastre 
            information are required as part of a single application or the application 
            must proceed through several steps, you can add multiple services to 
            the application. The categories of services supported by SOLA 
            Lesotho are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lease Services   </li>
                <li>Registration Services</li>
                <li>Survey Services</li>
                <li>Supporting Services</li>
            </ul>
        <p> Changes made to the land register information as part of a service 
            must be justified by a document of some kind. This could be a completed 
            application form requesting a particular change or it could be a legal 
            or official document (e.g. survey plan) describing a change to the land 
            register information. These documents must be scanned and linked to 
            the SOLA application in support of services.  If the documents required 
            by a service are not linked to the application, SOLA will not allow 
            the service to be completed. The documents required for each service 
            are noted in the following sections. You can obtain more details about 
            a specific document type from the Documents section.
        </p>
        <h2>Lease Services</h2>

        <p>Lease Services can be used to add, modify or terminate lease and sublease 
            rights. It will be the responsibility of the LAA Lease Services Division 
            to process these services. 
            
        <br>Note that LAA Registration Services are responsible for formally registering 
            changes to lease information. Each application that changes lease details 
            will also need to include a Registration On Lease service to allow LAA 
            Registration Services to formally register and complete the application.</p>
