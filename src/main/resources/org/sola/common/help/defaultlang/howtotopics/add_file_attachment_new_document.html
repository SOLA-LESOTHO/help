            <li>The maximum size of a file that can be attached into SOLA 
                is 100Mb. Files larger than this should be resized or split and 
                added as 2 or more documents. </li>
            <li>If you successfully attach a file from the Remote disk, 
                the file will be automatically deleted from the remote file location.</li>
