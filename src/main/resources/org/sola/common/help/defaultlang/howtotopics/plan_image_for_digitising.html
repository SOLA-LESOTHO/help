        <h1>Add a Plan Image for Digitising</h1>
        
        <p>When performing a Change to Cadastre or Redefine Cadastre service, 
            you can choose to add an image of the plan to the Map Viewer to assist 
            with digitizing the survey point data directly from the plan. </p>
        
        <p>To add a plan image to the map you must first have an image file available 
            on your local hard drive. The file formats supported by the Map Viewer 
            are TIFF, PNG and JPEG. Before adding the image, you should also select 
            the target parcels as they may be difficult to select after the image is added. </p>
        
        <p>The Add Image tool
             <img style="width: 32px; height: 23px;" alt="" src="../images/58_add_image_icon.png">
             works by matching two points you select on the map with two points you select from 
             the image. Before adding the image, you should compare the plan to the Map Viewer 
             and identify two candidate plot nodes that exist on both the plan and the Map Viewer.  
             For the best match accuracy, the first node you select should be at the bottom 
             left of the plan image and the second point at the top right (or top 
             left and bottom right). Note that the current Add image tool does not 
             rotate the image and requires the plan to have a standard North 
             orientation. If the plan does not have a standard North orientation, 
             use an appropriate imaging software package (e.g. Microsoft Office 
             Picture Manager) to rotate the plan image so that North for the plan 
             is the top of the computer screen before adding the image to the map.  </p>
        
            <p>Once you have the image file ready, identify the two matching points 
                and select your target plots, then click the Add image tool
                <img style="width: 32px; height: 23px;" alt="" src="../images/58_add_image_icon.png">
                You will be prompted to select the first of two points on the Map Viewer. 
                Zoom in if necessary to ensure your selection is accurate. You 
                will then be prompted to select a second point. Again, zoom in 
                if necessary to ensure your selection is accurate.   </p>
            
            <p>The Add Image tool will then prompt you to select your image file 
                from your local hard drive. Upon making your selection, the image 
                file will be displayed in the Add Image Preview dialog. You can 
                enlarge this dialog as necessary to improve your selection accuracy. 
                Click the image at the location matching the first point you 
                selected from the map. A green cross will appear on the image. 
                Click the image at the location matching the second point from 
                the map and a second green cross will appear. </p><br>
            
            <img style="width: 697px; height: 588px;" alt="" src="../images/add_image_preview.png"><br>

            <p>To proceed, click the OK button on the Add Image Preview dialog. 
                The image will be scaled as required and displayed in the Map Viewer.  
                The image will display on top of the standard Map Viewer navigation 
                layers, but will appear below the editing layers added for Change 
                to Cadastre and Redefine Cadastre. </p>

            <p>If you make a mistake, you can remove the image from the Map 
                Viewer using the Remove Image tool 
                <img style="width: 32px; height: 23px;" alt="" src="../images/59_remove_image_icon.png"><br>
                and re-add the image. You can also change your selections in the 
                Add Image Preview dialog by re-selecting the location of the first 
                point after you have added the second point. Be aware that re-selecting 
                the first point will require you to re-select your second point as well. </p>
