        <h1> Add Ownership Details to a Property<br> </h1>

        <p>You can add ownership details to a property using either the Register New Ownership 
            service or the New Digital Title service. Register New Ownership applies if the 
            property exists in SOLA and the ownership details are changing due to sale of 
            the property or a related ownership transfer transaction. The New Digital Title 
            service can be used to create new property records in SOLA as well as register 
            all of the necessary rights / restrictions to the property including ownership, 
            leases, restrictions, etc </p>
        <p>Using an assigned application, start the ownership related service from the 
            Application Details Services tab to open the Property Details screen. 
            On the Rights / Restrictions tab select the Ownership right (this may be 
            pre-selected for the Register New Ownership service) and click Create. 
            This will open the Ownership details screen.</p> <br>

        <img style="width: 400px; height: 250px;" alt="" src="../images/44_ownership_details.png"><br>

        <p>Tick the Primary Right checkbox to indicate this is the primary right for the property. 
            Enter a suitable Notation and add references to documents that justify the 
            ownership change.</p>
        <p>Ownership rights consist of one or more shares which are expressed as fractions.  
            The fractions from all current shares on the property must sum to 1. To enter a 
            new share for the property, click Add in the Shares section</p>
        <p>A share may be allocated to one or more parties. A party can be an individual or an 
            entity. Shares that are allocated to more than one individual or more than one 
            entity are considered undivided (a.k.a. commonly owned). This means SOLA does not 
            record the exact share for each party, simply that multiple parties participate in 
            the same share. The picture below illustrates an undivided share between John 
            and Jane Smith.  In this case the share is 1/1 meaning John and Jane own the 
            entire property between them, however the percentage owned by John vs the 
            percentage owned by Jane is not specified</p><br>
        <img style="width: 600px; height: 331px;" alt="" src="../images/45_share_details.png"><br>
        <p>
            To add parties to the share, click Add. This will open the Party Details screen 
            allowing you to enter in details for an individual or an entity. Once the necessary 
            party details have been entered, click Create. 
        </p><br>
        <img style="width: 600px; height: 331px;" alt="" src="../images/46_new_party.png"><br>
        <p>
            Once all parties have been added to the share, click Create on the Share Details 
            screen and once all shares have been added to the Ownership right, click Create on 
            the Ownership Details screen. The Property Details screen will then show a pending 
            Ownership right. Click Save on the Property Details screen to save the new ownership 
            details. 
        </p><br>
        <img style="width: 600px; height: 331px;" alt="" src="../images/47_property_details_rights.png"><br>
        <p>
            To complete the change in ownership, complete the ownership related service using the 
            Complete tool on the Application Details Services tab and then approve the application.
