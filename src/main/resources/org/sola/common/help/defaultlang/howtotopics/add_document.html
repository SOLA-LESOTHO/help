                 was not dated, then enter today’s date.</li> 
            <li>Reference (Deed Number) &#8211;Recommended. If the document is a

           <li>Attachment &#8211;Recommended. The name of the file that contains 
               the image of the document. Use the ellipses button “...” to open

            Attorney Search tabs that allow you to search existing SOLA documents 
            for a file that was previously attached. This can be a useful way to 
            link registered Power of Attorney documents as well as reference other
