        <h1>Vary Lease</h1>

        <p>Vary Lease is used to change the land use for a lease. Lessees must 
            provide a valid approval form from local government to confirm the 
            land use for the lease has changed. The Process for the Vary Lease 
            service is similar to that for Renewal of Lease except that you only 
            need to update the Land Use on the Lease Details screen to reflect 
            the new land use value. You should also re-calculate or update the 
            Ground Rent to reflect the change in land use. Once you have made 
            the necessary changes to Land Use and Ground Rent, you also need to 
            print the Lease Vary letter from the Print dropdown in the Lease Details screen.   </p>
        
        <p>Refer to the Renewal of Lease section for guidance</p>
