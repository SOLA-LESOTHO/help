        <h1>Registration on Sublease</h1>

        <p>The Registration on Sublease service serves the same purpose as the 
            Registration on Lease service. It allows LAA Registration services to 
            formally register the changes made for a sublease. The process for the 
            Registration on Sublease service is similar to that for Registration on 
            Lease service with the exception that you should select a Sublease right 
            to record the registration details against instead of a Lease right. </p>

        <p>Refer to the steps described in the Registration on Lease section for guidance.  </p>
