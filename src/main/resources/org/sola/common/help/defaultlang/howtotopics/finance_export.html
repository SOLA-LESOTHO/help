<h1>Finance Export</h1>
<p>The Finance Export can be used to create a CSV file containing details about 
    leases required for the LAA Finance System so that the Finance System can 
    produce bills and statements for Ground Rent and manage Ground Rent payments. 
    The Finance Export screen can be accessed from the File >

    Finance Export menu option.

<br>You can search for recently registered leases using the Registration Date range 
    and choose to export individual lease details by manually selecting the leases to export ( 
    <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/export_selected_icon.png">
    Export selected) or export all leases within the specified date range (
    <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/export_all_icon.png">
    Export all). 

    <br>The details exported to the CSV file include:
    <ol>
        <li>The person or organization responsible for making the payment (payer)</li>
        <li>The amount of the payment (i.e. the ground rent)</li>
        <li>The right holders names (i.e. Lessee names)</li>
        <li>The plot number and the plot area.</li>
    </ol>

    <br>When performing the export you will be prompted to indicate the file location for 
    the CSV export file. The export file must then be manually transferred or emailed for 
    manual upload into the LAA Finance System.
