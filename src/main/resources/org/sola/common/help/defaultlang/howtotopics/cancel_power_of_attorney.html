       <h1>Cancel Power of Attorney</h1>

        <p>This service is used to revoke a Power of Attorney. The Power of Attorney 
            will remain linked to any applications or property transactions it was 
            associated with prior to being revoked but it will not be possible to 
            use the Power of Attorney on any new applications. </p>

            <li>This service does not directly reference a property or plot so

            <li>On the Documents tab, record each of the physical documents provided 
                by the person cancelling the POA. </li>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Ensure you select the appropriate document type and record 
                    the document date (i.e. the date recorded on the face of the 
                    physical document) or todayâ€™ s date if the physical document is not dated. </li>
                <li>Enter a reference number for the document and a description. 
                    The reference number should be taken from the physical document. 
                    If the physical document does not have any reference number, 
                    then enter the application number, period and document 
                    sequence number (e.g. 120001.03). </li>
                <li>The Source Agency is the name of the organization that created 
                    the physical document. E.g. For the POA, this may be the name 
                    of the grantor. This field is optional and can be left blank</li>
            </ol>

                Save button. This will lodge the application and produce the lodgement 
                notice. Print the notice and give it to the person as proof the 
                application has been lodged. The lodgement notice will indicate

            <li>From the SOLA Dashboard, check the Unassigned applications list 
                to confirm the fee for the application has been paid. If the fee 
                has not been paid it will not be possible to assign the application. 
                In this situation notify the person noted as the contact and/or cashier 
                to confirm the payment status for the application </li>
