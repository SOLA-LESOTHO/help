<h1>Redefine Cadastre</h1>

<p>The Redefine Cadastre screen allows you to change the boundaries of an existing 
    plot both entirely and point by point (adding nodes and changing node coordinates) 
    outside of the receipt of a survey plan. This may be required due to general 
    maintenance of the cadastral network and/or correction of erroneous data. </p><br>

<h2>Lodge an Application</h2>

<p>To redefine the cadastre, you must lodge a new application in SOLA containing 
    a Redefine Cadastre service. </p>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Discuss and confirm the changes required with your team leader. </li>
    <li>From the Dashboard, select the   
        <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/03_new_application_icon.png">
        New application tool to open the Application Details screen.  </li>
    <li>On the General tab, enter the contact details for the person 
        making the request and select the agent from the Agent drop down if appropriate.  </li>
    <li>On the Services tab, add the Change to Cadastre service to the application.</li>
    <li>You can optionally list the plots affected by the application on the Plot tab. </li>
    <li>On the Documents tab, create a Complete Survey Report document and 
        attach the documentation that describes the change and clarifies why the 
        change is being made.  Enter todayâ€™s date for the document. The other 
        fields can remain blank.    </li>
    <li>On the Services tab, check the Fee Paid checkbox then click the
        <img style="width: 20px; height: 21px;" alt="" src="../images/save_icon.png">
        Save button. This will lodge the application and produce the lodgement notice. 
        You can close the lodgement notice without printing it. If you do not have 
        permission to check the Fee Paid checkbox, save the application and arrange 
        for a person with the appropriate privilege to do this for you.  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Assign the Application</h2>

<p>Before work can begin on changing the map, the application must first get assigned 
    to a Survey staff member. Assignment of the application indicates that work on 
    the application is underway.</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Assuming the Fee Paid checkbox is checked, select the application in the 
        Unassigned applications list and click the 
       <img style="width: 68px; height: 20px;" alt="" src="../images/06_assign_icon.png">
       Assign tool. This will open the Application Assignment dialog.   </li>
    <li>Click the Assign button to assign the application. When the Assign 
        action is complete, you will be returned to the Dashboard and the assigned 
        application will appear in your Assigned applications list.   </li>
</ol>

<h2>Redefine Cadastre Service</h2>

<p>The Redefine Cadastre service provides tools that allow you to modify the existing 
    cadastral network. The following describes the basic process flow for changing 
    the map. Variations to this basic flow are possible.</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>From the Dashboard,
        <img style="width: 55px; height: 21px;" alt="" src="../images/51_open.png">
        Open the application from your Assigned applications list. </li>
    <li>On the Services tab, select the Change to Cadastre service and click the
        <img style="width: 21px; height: 22px;" alt="" src="../images/start_again_icon.png">
        Start tool. This will open the Change to Cadastre screen.  </li>
    <li>If the Map Viewer is not already zoomed to the location of the survey, 
        use the map search or the map navigation tools to locate the area 
        of the survey.  </li>
    <li>Use Node tools and/or Boundary Change tools to update plots as required.</li>
    <li>Once all of the relevant information from the plan has been captured into 
        SOLA, return to the Services tab of the Application Details screen, select 
        the Redefine Cadastre service and click the 
        <img style="width: 19px; height: 23px;" alt="" src="../images/complete_icon.png">
        Complete tool. This will run the SOLA business rules to validate the application 
        data. If there is a critical failure, you must remedy the failure as it 
        will not be possible to approve the application otherwise.  </li>    
</ol>

<h3>Notes</h3>


<ul>
    <li>Use <img style="width: 20px; height: 21px;" alt="" src="../images/save_icon.png">
        Save on the Redefine Cadastre screen regularly. </li>
    <li>The act of saving and/or completing the service will cause the 
        SOLA business rules to run validating the state of the data. 
        If you receive rule failures, check 
        <a href="business_rules.html" target="_top">Business Rules</a>
        to determine how those failures can be remedied.   </li>
    <li>Additional information on using the Change to 
        Cadastre tools can be found in the Change to Cadastre section. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Approval</h2>

<p>The changes you make to the cadastral network while using the Redefine Cadastre 
    tools remain pending until the application is approved. Survey approval in 
    SOLA can be achieved using the  
    <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/approve_application_icon.png">
    Approve action in the Application action dropdown.   </p>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Open the application from your Assigned applications list and use the 
        <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/validate_icon.png">
        Validate tool to check the status of the application data. If 
        there are any rule failures, review the application data and correct 
        the issues as appropriate before proceeding to approve the application.  </li>  
    <li>Use the <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/approve_application_icon.png">
        Approve action in the Application action dropdown to approve the application.
        This will update the status of the application to Approved as well 
        as update the cadastral network with the information captured from the survey.       </li>
    <li>Following approval, you can complete the application immediately using the 
        <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/archive_icon.png">
        Archive action in the Application action dropdown.   </li>
</ol>
