        <h1>Add or Edit Agents and Banks</h1>

        <p>Agents are listed in the Agent drop down on the Application Details screen and 
            are required to lodge new Applications. Banks are required when entering or 
            modifying mortgage details.  
        </p>

        <p>The Party search screen allows you to quickly locate and add or modify agent 
            and bank details. To locate all agents in SOLA, search using the Lodging Agent 
            role. To locate all banks, search using the Bank role. You can edit the agent 
            or bank details by selecting the appropriate search result and clicking the 
            <img style="width: 52px; height: 23px;" alt="" src="../images/07_edit_icon.png">
            tool. This will open the Party Details screen.
        </p>

        <p>When adding a new Agent or a new Bank, make sure you configure the appropriate 
            party role(s). Agents require the Lodging Agent and banks require the Bank role.  
        </p>

        <p>If you need to remove an Agent or Bank so they are no longer available for 
            selection when lodging a new application or modifying mortgage details, simply 
            remove the Lodging Agent or Bank role from the party record. You can try to 
            use the Party search remove function, but that may fail if the agent or bank 
            has already been linked to an application or mortgage.
