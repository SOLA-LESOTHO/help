<h1>Lodge an Application for Lease Services</h1>

<p>When a customer submits a completed application form requesting a lease 
    service from the LAA such as a grant of new lease, lease transfer, renewal 
    of lease, etc., it will be the responsibility of a Customer Services 
    Representative to lodge an application in SOLA so that the appropriate 
    updates can be made. </p>

<h2>Lodge an Application</h2>

<p>Lodging the application should be done while the agent or applicant is in attendance 
    so that you can provide them with the lodgement notice. <br>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>From the Dashboard select the 
            <img style="width: 49px; height: 23px;" alt="" src="../images/52_add_icon.png">
            New application tool to open the Application Details screen.</li>
    <li>On the General tab, enter the contact details for the person making
                the request and select the agent from the Agent drop down if appropriate. </li>
    <li>On the Services tab,  <img style="width: 49px; height: 23px;" alt="" src="../images/52_add_icon.png">
        Add the service that matches the lease service requested by the customer.</li>
    <li>IMPORTANT: Unless the service requested by the customer is Consent 
        Application, you must also select the Registration On Lease service and 
        <img style="width: 49px; height: 23px;" alt="" src="../images/52_add_icon.png"> 
        Add it to the application. The Registration On Lease service will be completed 
        by the LAA Registration Services division to formally register the changes 
        to the lease. </li>
    <li>Where the lease service is to transact over a registered property (e.g. 
        Transfer Lease, Renewal of Lease, Endorsement, etc.), go to the Properties 
        tab and search for the property that will be affected.  Once you have 
        located the property, <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/complete_icon.png">
        Select it to link it to the application.</li>
    <li>Where the land service is to transact over a plot (i.e. Grant of New Lease), 
        go to the Plots tab and search for the plot that will be affected.  Once 
        you have located the plot, <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/complete_icon.png">
        Select it to link it to the application. </li>
    <li>On the Documents tab, record each of the physical documents provided by the 
        customer. The documents required are dependent on the service(s) selected. 
        When capturing document information</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Ensure you select the appropriate document type and record 
                the document date (i.e. the date recorded on the face of the physical 
                document) or todayâ€™ s date if the physical document is not dated</li>
            <li>Enter a reference number for the document and a description. 
                The reference number should be taken from the physical document. 
                If the physical document does not have any reference number, then 
                enter the application number (if known)</li>
            <li>The Source Agency is the name of the organization that created the 
                physical document. For example, this could be the bank for mortgage 
                documents, or the agents firm details for agreements and other 
                document types. This field is optional and can be left blank. </li>
            <li>If you have scanned the document, use the Attachment field to link 
                in the scanned image. IMPORTANT: If you have not yet scanned the 
                document, you will need to do this at a later stage and link it into 
                the document using the Edit Document functionality available from 
                Document Search. </li>
        </ol>
    <li>Click the <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../images/save_icon.png">
        Save button. This will lodge the application and produce the lodgement notice. 
        Print the notice and give it to the customer as proof the application has 
        been lodged. </li>
